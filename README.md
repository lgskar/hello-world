# hello-world
first repository on github
Hello,
My name is Lloyd.
I have been a longtime linux user(12 years). mostly distrohopping.
I am currently enrolled in cs50 online course offered by Harvard, and am really enjoying it.
I am hoping the course will help me break into the programming industry and even if it doesn't, it has been something that will
be a great hobby.
